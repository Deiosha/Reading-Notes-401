### Reading Questions

1. How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?
The random module can be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list by using functions such as randint(), random(), choice(), randrange() and shuffle() function.

2. In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?
A risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. The key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project is Searching the risk, Analyzing the impact of each individual risk, and Measures for the risk identified

3. What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?
Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase. It is important because it helps to ensure all software that is developed is tested and that the code was executed. 

4. What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity.
Big O notation is used to identify an algorithm's performance or time complexity. One example is washing dishes. We can observe how long it takes me to wash plates. As I wash each plate for the same amount of time and stack each clean plate, that would be O(n).

## Thing I want to learn more about:
What are other measurments of Big 0 notation.
