1.What are the critical differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

- The critical difference between classes and objects in Python is that classes contain attributes and methods. They are a template to construct your objects. At the same time, objects create variables and functions into a single commodity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes.

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?
- The concept of recursion is a programming method in which a function calls itself to decode a problem. It can be used to compute the factorial of a number. 

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.
-The objective of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing python code is the reusable objects that can be used to set up and tear down test environments. Code coverage can help pinpoint code spots that are not being tested. At the same time, Pytest fixtures can be used to simplify the configuration of test environments, decreasing code repetition and making tests easier to read and support.

## Things I want to know more about
Which method is found more useful between pytest fixtures and code coverage?
