# Readings: Cryptography

1. What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

- The basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher is a straightforward encryption method used in the past to cover private messages from being read by unauthorized individuals.

2. What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

- The key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is that Symmetric encryption operates the same key for encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption utilizes a pair of keys for the respective operations, offering more robust security but at a slower speed.

3. How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

- Computers generate random numbers using physical processes or algorithms. Physical processes generate random numbers from unanticipated references. Algorithms generate random numerals but are predictable based on an initial value, making them more efficient for non-cryptographic uses like simulations or games.

4. Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.

- Encryption is like placing your message into a private code that can only be comprehended by an individual who has the unique decoding key. It keeps your message secure from anyone who doesn't have the key. Decryption is the process of using that special key to convert the coded message back into its original, understandable form.
