Data Structures and Algorithms:

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
One of the most important thing I should consider when deciding which data structure us best suited to solve a particular problem is finding the data structure that meets the requirements more accurately. 

How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
To ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack, we’ll have to have one branch and use if/else statements
