1. In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?

- Arrow functions simplify function syntax, allowing concise and clear expression of functions with implicit returns, lexically scoped this, and compact syntax, making the code more readable and reducing the need for function binding workarounds. The let and const keywords provide block-scoping for variables, addressing issues with variable hoisting and enabling developers to write more robust and predictable code. Enhanced object literals, including shorthand property notation, computed property names, and method definitions, streamline object creation and manipulation, resulting in cleaner and more expressive code.

For example, you can use the class "bg-blue-500" to apply a background color of blue-500 to an HTML element
