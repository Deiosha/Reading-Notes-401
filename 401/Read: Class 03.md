### Class Reading: 03

Reading and Writing Files in Python is very important and connects with this class material because it addresses the importance of a file and how modern systems manage some of their aspects which are formed into three main parts, Header, Data and End of File. The reading also discusses the importance of file paths because the path represents the location of a file. Python Exceptions reading mentions how if a program is terminated, it's due to a syntax error or an exception. This reading explains the difference between a syntax error and an exception. A syntax error is when the parser detects an incorrect statement, and an exception is an error that happens when syntactically correct Python code results in an error.
