My perspective is that you must deal with challenging obstacles to grow to achieve your goals.

I am also doing this to provide my younger siblings and me with a better lifestyle and show people in my community the many opportunities there are.

At the end of this journey, I want a full-time position working as a software developer and strengthening my programming skills.

Yes, I am doing this for me. I have always been passionate about programming and enjoy every step of my journey, including the difficult times.
