1. What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

- DRF permissions authenticate and authorize users, confirming that only authenticated users with the proper permissions can access and use API resources. By leveraging authentication methods and permission classes, DRF provides a flexible and customizable framework for securing APIs and enforcing access restrictions based on user roles, groups, and other factors.

2. In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

- The purpose of the select statement is to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. To retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees, I would write SELECT * FROM employees;

3. Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

- DRF Generic Views simplify the implementation of common API functionalities by providing pre-built views. For example, by using ListAPIView, you can easily retrieve a list of objects from a database, and by using CreateAPIView, you can create new objects by sending a POST request to the corresponding endpoint.
