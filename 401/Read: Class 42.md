# Reading Questions

1. What are dunder methods in Python, and how do they allow for the customization of built-in behavior in classes? Provide an example of a common dunder method and its purpose.

- Dunder methods in Python are particular methods with two underscores that authorize classes to determine their conduct for detailed processes. An example is  __len__ when named on objects of that class, allowing command over the object's length.

2. Explain the concept of an iterator in Python. How do you create a custom iterator using the iter() and next() methods, and why are they important for enabling iteration in a class?

- An iterator in Python is an object that supplies pass to components. Building a custom iterator operating iter() and next() allows iteration in a class, letting it be used for loops.

3. What is a generator in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function? Illustrate your answer with an example of a generator function using the ‘yield’ keyword.

- A generator in Python is a unique operation that uses 'yield' to deliver values one at a time, varying from standard operations that produce all values at once. 

4. Define decorators in Python and explain their primary use case. How can you create and apply a custom decorator to a function or method? Provide a simple example to demonstrate this concept.

- Decorators are operations that alter the behavior of different operations or methods by covering them with extra functionality. To design and use a tailored decorator, define a function that accepts the target function as its argument, executes the expected behavior, and returns a new operation with the counted functionality using '@'  outside the target function.
