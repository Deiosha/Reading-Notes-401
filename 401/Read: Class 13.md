# Readings: Linear Regressions

1. Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

- The basic concept of linear regression is used to model the relationship between two variables, usually represented as X and Y. Its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis is to locate the most suitable line of fit that can indicate the properties of Y based on the values of X. 

2. Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

- The process of implementing a linear regression model using Python's Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions, is first to Import the required libraries needed, then load the database/prepare the data, split the data, construct the linear regression model, then assess the model's performance.

3. What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?

- The purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets is to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data that it has yet to be trained on. This contributes to the evaluation of a machine learning model's performance by authorizing us to calculate how thoroughly the model can generalize to new, unseen data.
