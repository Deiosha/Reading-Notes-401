3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

Function-based views are defined as Python functions and are simpler and more concise, while class-based views are defined as Python classes and offer more flexibility and built-in functionality such as mixins and inheritance.
