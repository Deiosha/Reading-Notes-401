Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.
Variable scope is part of a program where a variable is visual and attainable. Variables can have local or global scope, which specifies where they can be accessed and changed. The difference between local and global scope is local scope refers to variables that are represented within a function or block of code. In comparison, global scope is the names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?
The nonlocal keyword is when a variable is declared in the outer scope, not the global scope. It allows you to change a variable not in the current scope but in an outer scope.

In your own words, describe the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis.
From my understanding, Big O notation is used to calculate the time and space complexity of an algorithm. Each form of Big O explains the performance of an algorithm's differences as the input changes. 

Based on the Rolling Dice Example, explain how you would simulate a dice roll using Python. Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials.
How I would calculate the probability of rolling a specific number will be by using a form of a loop to mimic all of the rolls and calculate the number of times the number is seen.
