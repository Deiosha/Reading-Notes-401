1. What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?

- The primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) is to securely transmit information between parties as a compact and self-contained format.

3. Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?
