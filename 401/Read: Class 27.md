# Readings: Django Models

1. Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

- The purpose of Django models is to define the structure and behavior of data stored in a database, acting as a representation of database tables. They help in creating and managing the database schema by providing a convenient and Pythonic way to define the fields, relationships, and constraints of the data, allowing for seamless interaction with the database and automatic schema migrations.

2. Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?

- The Django Admin interface is a feature-rich tool for managing data in a Django application, offering CRUD operations, search, and filtering. It can be customized by defining admin classes and overriding templates to suit project-specific requirements.

3. Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

- A Django application consists of models for data structure, views for request handling, and templates for rendering HTML pages. These components work together: the user interacts with the browser, which sends a request to the server; the server routes the request to a view, which interacts with models and renders a template, providing a functional web application.
