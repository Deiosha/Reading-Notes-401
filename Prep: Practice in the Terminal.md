Prep: Practice in the Terminal:
The command line is a text-based interface to the system. When you enter a command by typing it on a keyboard, feedback will be given to you similarly to text. You get to a command line by going to the terminal under applications, then utilities. Basic Navigation teaches you how to work through command lines. I also learned that I found interesting in flies is that everything is a file, including my keyboard, and that Linux is case-sensitive. Manual pages are beneficial because they explain every command available in my system. My ah-ha moment was when I was working with file manipulation and learning how to better navigate through my directory. The cheat sheet was beneficial because when I forget a command, I can refer to the page and find the primary Navigation.
